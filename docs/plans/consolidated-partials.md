# Consolidated Partials — Outstanding Work Across 🚧 Plans

One place for every **deferred / partial** item pulled out of the in-progress (🚧) plans. The house
style ships a deterministic, headless-tested core first and defers the live edge; this doc gathers
those deferred edges so the remaining work is visible in a single list instead of scattered across
plan docs.

Three buckets, by what unblocks them:

- **A. Buildable now** — headless software follow-ups. These can be picked up as normal one-PR
  sub-plans today; nothing external is required. **This is the actionable backlog.**
- **B. Hardware-pending** — needs the glasses / mic / camera / on-device model / audio routing to
  *do* or *validate*.
- **C. Backend/service-pending** — needs a gateway, relay, or external API to exist/be reachable.

A 🚧 plan whose only remaining work sits in **B** or **C** is **complete to the extent verifiable** —
treat it as done for code purposes; the row is its validation/integration checklist. When a buildable
item (A) lands, or a dependency for B/C appears, work it and update the originating plan doc's status,
then strike it here.

## How to use this

- **Want to ship something today?** Pick from **A** — each is a normal deterministic-core sub-plan PR.
- **Bucket B/C rows are not code debt** — they're the validation/integration checklist for when the
  hardware or backend exists. Most are an afternoon of wiring + validation once the dependency lands.
- When an item is done, update its originating plan doc's status and remove its row here.
